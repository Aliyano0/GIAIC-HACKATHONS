Instructions for Testing

Testing Navigation:

Test the navigation menu on both desktop and mobile devices.

Search Functionality:

Test the search feature by searching for items using category names.

Confirm that the correct products display for each search.

Add to Cart:

Add items with varying quantities to the cart.

Verify that items appear on the cart page and that the total amount updates correctly.

Responsiveness:
  Resize the browser window or use Chrome Dev Tools to test responsiveness on different screen sizes.

Category Filter:
  Apply each filter and confirm that the displayed results match the selected category.

Error Handling:
  Simulate an API disconnection and confirm that an error message appears instead of product data.

This concludes the report for Day 5, detailing testing outcomes, optimization efforts, challenges faced, and security measures implemented. The platform is now more robust, responsive, and optimized for performance.
